    After years on the road facing threats both living and dead, a secluded
    school might finally be Clementines chance for a home. But protecting
    it will mean sacrifice. In this gripping, emotional final season, your
    choices will define your relationships and determine how Clementines
    story ends. 

    Features:
    - Emotional, Gut-Wrenching Story - See Clementines journey through to 
      the end. As she builds a new life, you will have to grapple with new
      types of choices and live with the consequences as AJ looks on, 
      learning from your every move.
    - More Control, More Tension - A new over-the-shoulder camera system,
      greater freedom to explore detailed environments, and scenes of un-
      scripted combat capture the fear of living in a world overrun by the
      undead. All this creates the most engaging The Walking Dead game yet.
    - Striking New Visual Style - The all-new Graphic Black art style rips
      the ink from the pages of the Eisner Award-winning comic book series
      and brings the world of The Walking Dead to life like never before.

    The eShop version was released by BigBlueBox:
    The.Walking.Dead.The.Final.Season.eShop.NSW-BigBlueBox
    ... and the update from Suxxors:
    The_Walking_Dead_Final_Season_Update_v1.0.1_NSW-SUXXORS

    This is the classic game cartridge version (revision 1.0.2). Collectors
    may enjoy it (or not) - decide it on your own ...

    In our eyes this is a very disappointing retail version, coz the  
    language update packs and other episodes (beside the first
    one) have to be downloaded. Also old "release dates" are still in the 
    mainscreen (without online update).
    Why not publishing a updated version with all episodes included?
